= Connect JBoss EAP 8.0 to a PostgreSQL database on OpenShift

== The Application

The `src/main` folder contains a simple application exposing a REST endpoint which allows users to post data. Posted data is stored in a database. Then there is an endpoint allowing users to get data stored in the database.

=== Deploying the application on OpenShift with Helm

To install the application on OpenShift, you can install a Helm release that will deploy a PostgreSQL database and build and deploy the application with EAP 8.0.

Please follow https://jboss-eap-up-and-running.github.io/helm-charts/[the instructions] to set up the Helm examples in OpenShift and install the 
`JBoss EAP 8.0 + PostgreSQL` Helm example.

=== Running the 'simple' setup application

Create a few entries in the database by running the following POST commands:

[source,shell]
----
curl -k -X POST https://$(oc get route eap8-with-postgres --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/app?value=Hello+World
curl -k -X POST https://$(oc get route eap8-with-postgres --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/app?value=Bonjour+le+Monde
----

Then we can read the entries we added

[source,shell]
----
curl -k https://$(oc get route eap8-with-postgres --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/app
----
which should return

[source,shell]
----
["Hello World","Bonjour le Monde"]
----
